NOTE: If it isn't already obvious, hit enter after typing your command to activate it.


Enter the classroom
Log into your computer, your email, and github
Open terminal
Clone your repository by pasting in the saved link/command that you have in your email, in my case: git clone --config="http.proxy=http://sienna2169:chocolate@192.168.2.1:8080" https://github.com/sienna2169-cmis/sienna2169-cmis-wd.git
Type the command: ls ,to view all the files
Use the command cd (repository name) ,to change directories to your repository, where all your files are. In my case it is sienna2169-cmis-wd
Use the command ls again to display all the files in your repository
Type the command: gedit file.txt (to create the file called file.txt)
Edit the file in whatever way you are required to 
Once you are done, save and close the file.
Now, you must add the new file into your repository. This can be done using the command: git add file.txt
Next, you want to commit your repository. Use the command: git commit -m "Commit message" (NOTE: the commit message can be a brief description of what you edited or did. You do not actually write 'commit message' inside the quotation marks. In this case, it could be something like: git commit -m "Added a file called file.txt"). Commiting your repository will create a sort of snapshot of your work at that moment, like a milestone in case you have to revert back.
Next, you will push your repository back to github. This is done with the command: git push 
Enter your username and password for github.com 
Open github to check if your repository has been updated
Log out of everything and shut down your computer
Leave class.
