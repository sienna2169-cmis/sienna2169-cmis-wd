			Lists and Links
		</h2>
		<p>
			This assignment had us create a link to a page where we make a list of useful links that can help us during the test. There, we also made an ordered list of steps to remember when creating and styling a website to be viewed in the production server. Basically, it's a giant guide/cheatsheet to help us out when we take the test.

		<ul>
		<li>
			Create a file called "listsandlinks.html" in your repository folder.
		</li>
		<li>
			In "listsandlinks.html" create an detailed ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage view it on the production server.
